Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation on Metasploitable Machine using Tenable Nessus on Windows VM
This project aims to identify and address security vulnerabilities on a Metasploitable machine using Tenable Nessus vulnerability scanner installed on a Windows virtual machine (VM).

# Objectives:
# 1. Install Tenable Nessus on a Windows VM.
- Configure a Windows and Metasploitable VM on a hypervisor (VirtualBox)
- Download Tenable Nessus on the Windows VM from  https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus
- Compare and verify SHA256 value for file integrity, from the downloaded file to tenable.com/downloads/nessus

# 2. Configure Network Access for Scanning:
- Ensure proper network connectivity between the Nessus VM and the Metasploitable machine.
- Configure firewall rules (if applicable) to allow Nessus to scan the Metasploitable machine.
# 3. Create and Run a Vulnerability Scan on Metasploitable:
- Design a Nessus scan template targeting the Metasploitable operating system.
- Execute the vulnerability scan on the Metasploitable machine.
Analyze the generated Nessus scan report for identified vulnerabilities.
Remediation of Identified Vulnerabilities:
Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and exploitability.
Research and identify appropriate remediation steps for each critical vulnerability based on the Nessus report and official resources.
Implement the identified remediation steps on the Metasploitable machine (e.g., applying security patches, updating software, configuring security settings).
Document and Report Findings:
Create a comprehensive report summarizing the Nessus scan results, identified vulnerabilities, and implemented remediation actions.
Include recommendations for future vulnerability management practices.
Note: This project is intended for educational purposes only. It's crucial to obtain permission before scanning any system other than your own.

This project provides a structured approach to identify and address security weaknesses on a vulnerable machine. By successfully completing this project, you will gain practical experience with Tenable Nessus, vulnerability scanning methodologies, and basic vulnerability remediation techniques.
